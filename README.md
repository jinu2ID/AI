This folder contains search algorithms for the Sliding Brick Puzzle and Othello: BFS, DFS, and AStar(IDS still needs to be implemented) for SBP  and Minimax and Monte Carlo for Othello.

I did not write the source code for the Othello game which consists of the OthelloState.java, OthelloMove.java, OthelloPlayer.java, and OthelloRandomPlayer.java. They were already provided. I only created the Iago(Minimax) and Desdemona(Monte Carlo) agents. The Monte Carlo agent also needs to be fixed as it does not work correctly.

For the Sliding Brick Puzzle I implemented all of the C++ files.
