Minimax agent for Othello


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program implements the minimax search in an Othello player agent.
Alpha-beta pruning has also been implemented to reduce the number of nodes searched.
This program was written in IntelliJIDEA 14.1.5 on a Windows 10 machine. It
was tested on Drexel's tux servers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO RUN

To run please run the "make" command from the java-othello-src directory
where the make file is located.

The Iago player is set to max search depth 8 and is set as player 2 in
Test.java
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Iago class extends the OthelloPlayer class. The constructor for Iago
takes an integer as an argument which is the max search depth for minimax.

The getMove function passes each possible move from the current state to the
minimax function and returns the one with the best score. getMove also
checks whether it is the maximizing or minimizing player's turn.

The Minimax function is a recursive function that searches until it reaches
max depth or until the game is over. If neither of these conditions are met
it recursively calls Minimax on all the successor states. Once a leaf node
is reached, scores are propogated back up the tree.  The maximizing section
of the code will return the highest values and the minimizing section will
return the lowest values. 

Alpha-beta pruning is implemented by checking the alpha and beta
values at each ply. If alpha is greater than or equal to beta then the
current move is worse than the already existing alpha or beta and will never
be selected. These nodes can therefore be pruned away to save time.
